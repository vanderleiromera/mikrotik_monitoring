### Description
MKTXP-Stack is a dockerized monitoring stack for [MKTXP Exporter](https://github.com/akpw/mktxp). 

As an out-of-the-box solution, it lets you quickly get up & running with [MKTXP](https://github.com/akpw/mktxp), [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/), and [Grafana](https://grafana.com/) and have multiple Mikrotik RouterOS devices monitored with least amount of configuration. 

While complementary to [MKTXP](https://github.com/akpw/mktxp), this project also adds some extra capabilities such an [centralized Mikrotik log processing](https://github.com/akpw/mktxp-stack#mikrotik-centralized-logging-configuration) based on a preconfigured  [syslog-ng](https://www.syslog-ng.com/) / [promtail](https://grafana.com/docs/loki/latest/clients/promtail/) / [Loki](https://grafana.com/docs/loki/latest) stack. 

The project offers multiple [docker-compose configurations](https://github.com/akpw/mktxp-stack/blob/main/README.md#alternative-docker-compose-configurations), for loading only relevant parts of the stack as well as for multiple log management options.


### Requirements:
[Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)


### Install & Getting Started:
 - Clone this repository (or download zip with wget)
```
git clone https://github.com/akpw/mktxp-stack.git
cd mktxp-stack
```

#### MKTXP Exporter configuration
- Following the steps described in [MKTXP Getting Started](https://github.com/akpw/mktxp#getting-started), let's:\
  a) edit the main mktxp config file, adding your Mikrotik device IP address & authentication info to provided sample entry:
  ```
  nano mktxp/mktxp.conf
  ```

  b) if needed, [add a dedicated API user](https://github.com/akpw/mktxp#mikrotik-device-config) from the mktxp config to your RouterOS device:
  ```
  /user group add name=mktxp_group policy=api,read
  /user add name=mktxp_user group=mktxp_group password=mktxp_user_password
  ```

With that out the of way, things should be ready for running docker-compose:
```
docker-compose -f ./docker-compose-mktxp-stack.yml up -d
```

Now give the containers some time to start up, and then point a Web browser to [Grafana](http://localhost:3000). You should see the default [MKTXP Exporter Dashboard](https://grafana.com/grafana/dashboards/13679-mikrotik-mktxp-exporter/):\

#### Mikrotik Centralized Logging configuration
In addition to RouterOS devices monitoring, MKTXP-Stack provides a preconfigured  [syslog-ng](https://www.syslog-ng.com/) / [promtail](https://grafana.com/docs/loki/latest/clients/promtail/) / [Loki](https://grafana.com/docs/loki/latest) stack to receieve & process logs from multiple Mikrotik RouterOS devices in a centralized location:

<img width="96%" alt="loki" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5028474/210771516-06a3e6ab-8eab-458c-9f38-5d44f95d23d4.png">

To make this work, we need to configure our Mikrotik devices to send their logs to a specified log server target. Let's first configure the corresponding remote logging action (replace XX.XX.XX.XX with your docker-compose host IP address):
```
/system logging action
set remote bsd-syslog=yes name=remote remote=XX.XX.XX.XX remote-port=514 src-address=0.0.0.0 syslog-facility=local0 syslog-severity=auto target=remote
```
Next, let's modify relevant log topics to use with this remote action:
```
/system logging
set 0 action=remote prefix=:Info
set 1 action=remote prefix=:Error
set 2 action=remote prefix=:Warning
set 3 action=remote prefix=:Critical

add action=remote disabled=no prefix=:Firewall topics=firewall
add action=remote disabled=no prefix=:Account topics=account
add action=remote disabled=no prefix=:Caps topics=caps
add action=remote disabled=no prefix=:Wireles topics=wireless
```
You can extend the list above as needed, following [Mikrotik's description](https://help.mikrotik.com/docs/display/ROS/Log) of the log topics used by various RouterOS facilities 

Now all should be ready and, unless you already done so during the previous [MKTXP Exporter configuration](https://github.com/akpw/mktxp-stack#mktxp-exporter-configuration), it's time for docker-compose:
```
docker-compose -f ./docker-compose-mktxp-stack.yml up -d
```
As soon as the containers are up & running, just point your Web browser to included [Grafana dashboards](http://localhost:3000/dashboards) and open the one called "Mikrotik Loki Logs".

## Alternative docker-compose configurations
The project offers multiple docker-compose files, for loading relevant parts of the stack as well as multiple log management options.

### Default stack
To go with default full stack, just run docker-compose as described above:
```
docker-compose -f ./docker-compose-mktxp-stack.yml up -d
```

### File-system based logs
If you want more control over managing your routers' logs, such a specific file-system location and separate log files:
```
docker-compose -f ./docker-compose-mktxp-stack-fs.yml up -d
```

This configuration makes it easy to implement log rotation or any additional management functionality on top. By default, the devices' logs will be send to `syslog-ng/logs/` where you can check it out with:
```
ls -l syslog-ng/logs/
```
ðŸ’¡ *With mktxp-stack up & running, it might take a while for newly added log files to appear in the dashboard. In case this happens, an easy solution is to restart the promtail and syslog containers via `docker restart promtail; docker restart syslog-ng`*

To set a different location on your mktxp-stack host, just edit the device path in the ```mktxp-stack/docker-compose-mktxp-stack-fs.yml``` configuration:
```
volumes:
  mktxp-logs:
    driver_opts:
       o: bind
       type: none
       device: $PWD/syslog-ng/logs
```


###  MKTXP Exporter only
Finally, in case you need just MKTXP Exporter functionality and no logs:
```
docker-compose -f ./docker-compose-mktxp-stack-no-logs.yml up -d
```
